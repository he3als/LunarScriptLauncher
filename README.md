# Lunar Script Launcher
A simple but customisable command line only batch script to launch [Lunar Client](https://www.lunarclient.com/) on Windows.

## FAQ
- **Where is the configuration file?** There is none, you edit the variables in the batch script.
- **There are so many other alternatives, why does this exist?** Other third-party Lunar Client launchers can be a bit bloated. For my needs, I do not need a GUI and I do not care that much about an updater (it would be nice though). Due to the simplistic design of this script, it is fast and easy to understand. However, it does not come without its limitations like no updating/installation support or no GUI (a [TUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface) may be coming in the future).
- **Batch kinda sucks, why are you using it?** While batch has its limitations, it works perfectly fine for being a simplistic Lunar Client launcher. There is no point in having like 3 programming languages in one application just for a simple launcher.
- **What can I do with it?** You can do whatever, I do not care. As stated in the license, you can literally do whatever you want. However, there is no support or warrenty.
